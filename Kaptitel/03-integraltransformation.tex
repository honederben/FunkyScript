$f \in L^1[-\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2}]$ lässt sich durch
FR darstellen. Was passiert mit FR, wenn 
$L \rightarrow \infty$ ?

$f(x)$ ; $x \in (-\infty; \infty)$ mit $f(x) \quad \underrightarrow{x \rightarrow \infty} \quad 0$
... genügend schnell.

Definiere periodische Funktion $f_L(x)$ mit:
$$f_L(x) = f(x) \quad , \quad -\frac{L}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{L}{2}$$

$FR$ für $f_L$ sollte existieren und soll entsprechend konvergieren

$$f_L(x) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty c_k e^{i\frac{2 \pi}{L}kx} \qquad
    c_n = \frac{1}{L} \int_{- \frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}} f(y) e^{-i\frac{2 \pi}{L}ky} \,dy$$

$$f_L(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}  \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty \left[ \frac{2\pi}{L} 
    \int_{- \frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}} f(y) e^{i\frac{2 \pi}{L}k(x-y)} \right] \,dy$$

$$\omega_k = \frac{2 \pi k}{L} \qquad \Delta \omega = \frac{2\pi}{L} \qquad
    g(\omega, x, L) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{- \frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}} f(y) 
    e^{i\omega (x-y)}\,dy$$

$$f(x)_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty \Delta \omega g(\omega_k, x, L)
    \qquad \vert x \vert < \frac{L}{2}$$

$\rightarrow$ kann Rieman'sche Summe betrachter werden $\underrightarrow{L \rightarrow \infty}$ 
Rieman'sches Integral

$$f(x)_L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\omega) e^{i \omega x} \,dw \quad
    \textrm{mit} \quad
    \hat{f}(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y) e^{-i \omega y} \,dy =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{-i \omega x} \,dx $$

\subsection{Testfunktionenräume und Distributionen}

\begin{Def}
    V VR über $\mathbb{K}$. Ein Funktional $F$ ist eine Abbildung:
    $$F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$$
    $$ \phi \in V \mapsto F(\phi) = \alpha \in \mathbb{K}$$

    Ein lineares Funktional $F$ erfüllt die Linearitätsbedingung
    $$F(\alpha \phi + \beta \psi) = \alpha F(\phi) + \beta F(\psi) \quad \phi , \psi \in V \quad \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{K} $$

    Die Menge aller linerarer Funktionale auf $V$
    $$V^\ast =  \{ F | F:V \rightarrow \mathbb{K} \quad linear \} $$

    bildet selbst bzgl. der "punktweisen" Addition und Multiplikation
    mit einem Skalar einen VR, den algebraischen Dualraum von $V$.
    $$(F+G)(\phi) = F(\phi) + G(\phi) \quad \forall \phi \in V $$
    $$(\alpha F)(\phi) = \alpha (F)(\phi)  \quad \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{K} \quad \forall \phi \in V $$
\end{Def}

\begin{Def}
    Der Raum der beliebig oft stetig diff-baren (komplex- oder 
    reellwertigen) Funktionen mit kompakten Trägern ist definiert als
    $$C_0^\infty (\mathbb{R}^n)  := \{ f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}(\mathbb{R}) | f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \textrm{ und } f(\vec{x})=0 \textrm{ für } \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus  \Omega \textrm{ mit } \Omega \textrm{ kompakt} \}$$
    $$( \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n \textrm{ kompakt } \Rightarrow \Omega \textrm{ abgeschlossen und beschränkt} )$$

    Bsp: $\phi = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
        e^{\frac{1}{x^2-1}} & |x| < 1 \\
        0 & \, |x| \geq 1 \\
        \end{array}
        \right. \quad \in C_0^{\infty} $
\end{Def}

\begin{Def}{Konvergenz in $C_0^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ \\}
    Eine Funktionenfolge $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \subset C_0^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ konvergiert gegen
    $f \in C_0^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$
    $$\Leftrightarrow \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \Vert D^\alpha f_k - D^\alpha f \Vert _{\Omega , \infty} = 0 \quad \forall 
    \alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n \quad \forall \Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n \textrm{ kompakt} $$
    $$ \rightarrow \max_{\vec{x} \in \Omega} \vert D^\alpha f_k(\vec{x}) - D^\alpha f(\vec{x}) \vert$$
\end{Def}
